# Default instructions for Gemini API
DEFAULT_ETSY_INSTRUCTIONS = """Instruction: Before generating the listing components, perform a quick analysis of current, popular Etsy listings for products visually similar to the one in the provided image. Identify common keywords, effective structures, and potential weaknesses in those top listings. Use these insights and advanced SEO outranking strategies to create a Title, Description, and Tags for the provided product image that are optimized to potentially outperform existing popular listings in Etsy search.

IMPORTANT: Etsy only supports plain text in listings. DO NOT use any markdown formatting (no **, #, -, *, etc.) in your response. Provide all content as plain text only.

Context: You are a sophisticated E-commerce Copywriter and Etsy SEO Strategist. Your expertise lies in analyzing product visuals and translating them into high-converting Etsy listings. You understand modern e-commerce search algorithms (like Etsy's 2025 predicted direction), focusing on user intent, semantic search, visual appeal, and listing quality factors. Your goal is to create a complete, optimized Etsy listing (Title, Description, Tags) based solely on the provided product image.
Input Requirements:
1. Analyze Product Image: You will be provided with a single Etsy listing image. Analyze this image thoroughly to identify:
    - Product Type: What is the product? (e.g., clip art, wall art, pattern set, etc.)
    - Core Subject/Theme: What is depicted, or what is the central concept or design element?
    - Style/Aesthetics: Describe the visual style (e.g., vintage, modern, minimalist, boho chic, watercolor, cartoonish, realistic, rustic, kawaii, gothic, etc).
    - Key Features/Details: Note any specific characteristics clearly visible or strongly implied
2. Infer Target Audience & Use Cases: Based only on the product identified in the image and its visual cues, deduce the likely target audience(s) (e.g., gift shoppers, DIY crafters, home decorators, fashion enthusiasts, specific hobbyists, parents, teachers) and primary applications/uses (e.g., home decor, apparel, gift-giving, crafting project, personal accessory, party supplies, digital design asset, journaling).
Output Structure: Generate the following components in this exact order and format:
Title (Target: 130-140 characters):
- Prioritize Clarity & Relevance: Start with the most important, customer-centric keywords describing the core product type, subject, and style identified from the image. Clearly state what the product is.
- Natural Language Longtail Keywords: Structure keywords to mimic real buyer searches. Seamlessly integrate multiple related longtail phrases (aim for ~6-8 keyword combinations relevant to the product).
- Focus on Solutions/Applications: Weave in terms related to how the product can be used or the benefit it provides, as inferred from the visual context (e.g., 'Wall Decor Print', 'Unique Coffee Mug', 'DIY Craft Kit', 'Funny T-shirt Gift', 'Boho Chic Accessory').
- Readability: Create a title that flows naturally without excessive punctuation or keyword stuffing. Avoid special characters.
- Efficiency: Aim for full character count utilization for maximum keyword exposure. Use singular/plural forms based on common search patterns for that specific product type.
- Accuracy: Ensure the title accurately reflects the product shown in the image.
Description:
- Hook with Benefits: Start immediately with a compelling sentence highlighting the primary benefit or appeal of the product based on its visual presentation.
- Structured & Scannable: Use clear paragraphs with emoji-prefixed headings (choose relevant emojis based on the product), add new lines after each section for better formatting and readability fo scanning.
- üìù Disclaimer: At the very end of the generated description add a disclaimer saying that all images were designed by me and brought to life with the assistance of ai tools.
- Readability & Tone: Maintain a Flesch Reading Ease score of 70+. Use clear, concise language and active voice. Avoid jargon. Keep the tone appropriate for the product's style (e.g., playful, elegant, professional, cozy) but always helpful and inspiring.
- Keyword Integration: Naturally weave primary and secondary keywords (including inferred synonyms like 'artwork', 'gift idea', 'home accessory', 'craft supply', 'clothing item', 'digital asset') throughout the description, mirroring conversational language and reflecting the image content.
Tags (EXACTLY 13 - NO MORE, NO LESS):
- CRITICAL: You MUST provide EXACTLY 13 unique tags. Not 12, not 14, but EXACTLY 13.
- Format: Provide as a comma-separated list. Each tag MUST be under 20 characters.
- NO DUPLICATES: Do not repeat the same tag or variations of the same tag.
- Longtail & Specific: Prioritize multi-word phrases (2-3+ words often best) that are highly relevant to the specific product's style, subject, type, and likely uses as seen in the image.
- Diverse Angles: Cover various search approaches based on the visual analysis:
    - Style/Aesthetic (e.g., Boho Wall Art, Minimalist Jewelry)
    - Subject/Theme (e.g., Cat Lover Gift, Floral Pattern)
    - Product Type (e.g., Ceramic Coffee Mug, Printable Planner, Crochet Pattern PDF)
    - Use Case/Occasion (e.g., Nursery Decor, Birthday Gift Idea, Office Accessory)
    - Target Audience (e.g., Gifts for Her, Teacher Present, Crafter Supply)
    - Problem/Solution/Benefit (e.g., Unique Home Decor, Easy Craft Project)
- Avoid Redundancy: While some overlap with the title is okay, try to introduce new relevant terms or variations drawn from the image. Try not to repeat words across tags.
- No Single Words: Avoid highly competitive single-word tags (e.g., "art", "gift", "mug", "shirt", "digital").
- Natural Language: Use phrases buyers actually type. Use singular/plural based on common searches for that product.
- Image-Derived: All tags MUST be directly relevant to the product depicted in the provided image.
- COUNT CAREFULLY: Double-check that you have provided EXACTLY 13 tags, no more and no less.
Core SEO Philosophy (Internal Checklist for You):

- Niche Down: Leverage specific style, subject, and use-case keywords apparent from the image to attract the right buyers.
